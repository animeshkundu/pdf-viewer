# Placeholder for Future Deprecations

This directory will contain documentation for deprecated features as the project evolves.

## Current Status

As of the initial project creation, no features have been deprecated yet. This directory structure is prepared for future use.

## When to Add Files Here

Add deprecation documentation when:
- Removing a feature or component
- Changing a public API
- Migrating from one technology to another
- Restructuring code in a breaking way

See [README.md](./README.md) for the full template and guidelines.
